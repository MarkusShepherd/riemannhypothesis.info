Hi, my name is Markus Shepherd (n√© Schepke). I'm just this guy from a [small (but pretty) town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerin) in the North East of Germany who has been studying mathematics in [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hanover) [places](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge), and is now earning money by pushing buttons. From December 2015 through August 2016 I had been [travelling around the world](http://www.mn-travel.club/) with my wife Natalia. Ever since, I've been located in the [Far North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki). Somewhere along the way, I'd like to understand more about primes. That's about it.

There's a number of [other projects](http://localhost:8885/riemannhypothesis.info/projects/) I'm working on, notably [Ludoj](https://ludoj.herokuapp.com/) and [Diris](https://diris-app.appspot.com/).
