Over the years I wrote a couple of mathematical notes that I would like to keep available. They are usually written with the intention of being very accessible, so are hopefully understandable with minimal prerequisites.

  * [On the Distribution of Squarefree Numbers in Arithmetic Progressions][1]: Master's thesis, supervised by Professor Jörg Brüdern at the University of Göttingen
  * [Adding Prime Numbers][2]: Essay for Part III of the mathematical tripos, supervised by Professor Ben Green at the University of Cambridge
  * [Primzahlerzeugende Folgen][3]: Bachelor's thesis (in German), supervised by Professor Stefan Wewers at the University of Hanover; partial English translation: [Prime Generating Sequences][4]
  * [Algebraic Number Theory][5]: Unofficial lecture notes on Algebraic Number Theory given in Michaelmas Term 2010 by Dr. Vladimir Dokchitser at the University of Cambridge
