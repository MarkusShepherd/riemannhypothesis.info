Hi, my name is Markus Shepherd (n√© Schepke). I'm just this guy from a [small (but pretty) town](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerin) in the North East of Germany who has been studying mathematics in [different](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Hanover) [places](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Cambridge), and is now earning money by pushing buttons. From December 2015 through August 2016 I had been [travelling around the world](http://www.mn-travel.club/) with my wife Natalia. Ever since, I've been located in the [Far North](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helsinki) with our cat Euler (really proud of that name!) and our daughter Stella (really proud of her!). Somewhere along the way, I'd like to understand more about primes. That's about it.

There's a number of [other projects]({{< ref "projects" >}}) I'm working on, notably [Recommend.Games](https://recommend.games/) and [Diris](https://diris-app.appspot.com/). If you'd like to get in touch, there's a bunch of social links at the bottom of every page, so take your pick.
