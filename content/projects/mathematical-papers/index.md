Over the years I wrote a couple of mathematical notes that I would like to keep available. They are usually written with the intention of being very accessible, so are hopefully understandable with minimal prerequisites.

* [On the Distribution of Squarefree Numbers in Arithmetic Progressions](/schepke_distribution_of_squarefree_numbers_in_arithmetic_progressions.pdf): Master's thesis, supervised by Professor Jörg Brüdern at the University of Göttingen
* [Adding Prime Numbers](/schepke_adding_prime_numbers.pdf): Essay for Part III of the mathematical tripos, supervised by Professor Ben Green at the University of Cambridge
* [Primzahlerzeugende Folgen](/schepke_primzahlerzeugende_folgen.pdf): Bachelor's thesis (in German), supervised by Professor Stefan Wewers at the University of Hanover; partial English translation: [Prime Generating Sequences](/schepke_prime_generating_sequences.pdf)
* [Algebraic Number Theory](/schepke_algebraic_number_theory.pdf): Unofficial lecture notes on Algebraic Number Theory given in Michaelmas Term 2010 by Dr. Vladimir Dokchitser at the University of Cambridge
