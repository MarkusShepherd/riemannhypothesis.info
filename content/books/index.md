This section is not so much a bibliography, but more list of books that I enjoyed reading. Some will help understand the Riemann Hypothesis or other parts of mathematics, some will entertain, and the best will do both...

  * [Books on the Riemann Hypothesis][1]
  * [Books on Mathematics in General][2]
  * [Mathematicians' Biographies][3]
  * [Mathematical Textbooks][4]
