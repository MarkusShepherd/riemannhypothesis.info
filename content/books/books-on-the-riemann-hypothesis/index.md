Captivating and insightful. If you're interested in the topic, there's basically no way around reading this. And for those that are afraid of maths: it's virtually free of formulae, but explains in great metaphors the beauty of the prime numbers and the significance the Riemann Hypothesis plays for them.

John Derbyshire does not flinch from doing actual maths (though he keeps calculus to a minimum), and generally succeeds in explaining the mathematical background of the Riemann Hypothesis to non-mathematicians -- this alone makes the book worth reading. The anecdotes, stories, and historical notes on the Riemann Hypothesis are a nice bonus, including to the most comprehensive account on Bernhard Riemann's life known to me.
